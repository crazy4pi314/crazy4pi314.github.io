excerpt: "So many new exciting features this month! Let's dive into them and see how they work."
---

I am so excited for this release folks, it has one of my top 3 most wanted features for the QDK!!

You can find here [the official QDK release notes for 0.12.20070124](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/resources/relnotes#version-01220070124), but I wanted to walk through and highlight some of the parts that I am most excited about. So let's get to it!

> **NOTE:** I'll use block quotes like this to indicate content from the release notes.

## Using Q# with Python and Jupyter just got soo much better!

There is so much in this release that makes developing Q# in Jupyter Notebooks and Python so much easier.
I have also noticed [a ton more documentation on the IQ# magic commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/iqsharp-magic/azure.connect), which was sorely needed.

> IQ# now allows arguments to the [%simulate](https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/iqsharp-magic/simulate), [%estimate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/qsharp/api/iqsharp-magic/estimate), and other magic commands. See the [%simulate magic command reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/iqsharp-magic/simulate) for more details.

I HAVE BEEN WANTING THIS FOREVER ðŸ˜»
It will be so much nicer to use Jupyter notebooks with Q# kernels now, you won't have to write stubs that would fill in the arguments you wanted.
Thanks so much to the team for getting this one implemented ðŸ’–

> New phase display options in IQ#. See the [%config magic command reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/iqsharp-magic/config) for more details.

The magic command %config is not new, but the addition of the [new docs for it](https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/iqsharp-magic/config) and some new config options like configuring how the phase is displayed when running callables like [`DumpMachine`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.diagnostics.dumpmachine) and [`DumpRegister`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.diagnostics.dumpregister). I really like the ability to actually turn them off as they can add a lot of noise when trying to demonstrate something that is independent of phase.

> IQ# and the `qsharp` Python package are now provided via conda packages ([qsharp](https://anaconda.org/quantum-engineering/qsharp) and [iqsharp](https://anaconda.org/quantum-engineering/iqsharp)) to simplify local installation of Q# Jupyter and Python functionality to a conda environment. See the [Q# Jupyter Notebooks](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/quickstarts/install-jupyter) and [Q# with Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/quickstarts/install-python) installation guides for more details.

I pretty much only use Anaconda distributions of Python and the addition of the `qsharp` package to conda will make managing environments a lot easier.
You can also get it from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/qsharp/), but it is more annoying if you are using conda envs instead of virtualenvs built into Python.
I find the conda envs more useful on occasion as you can specify things that are not Python packages as part of an environment (like if you needed a particular version of some .NET tooling).
You can see [a good comparison of features](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html#virtual-environments) for venv and conda envs on the conda docs.

> Updates to make it easier for IQ# users to consume library packages with different QDK versions, requiring only major & minor version numbers match rather than the exact same version

This one is also just a general quality of life improvement, I definitely ran into this where I had to have the _exact_ version of a package when using the `%package` magic command in a Q# Jupyter notebook. This makes maintenance tasks easier, and I think is just more what a dev might expect behaviorally. Check out [the `%package` docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/iqsharp-magic/package) for some examples!

## Legacy, we got chemistry ðŸ˜˜

> New qdk-chem tool for converting legacy electronic structure problem serialization formats (e.g.: FCIDUMP) to Broombridge

Full disclaimer that I am not a chemist, but I am familiar with having to manage data that is in multiple different encodings for a project and that is a nightmare.
This comes up in quantum chemistry applications as there is a step in the development loop where the chemist exports a description of the problem from their simulation software and wants to use that with the QDK. This release adds some new support for converting/using other serializations with the QDK which uses internally the [Broombridge schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/user-guide/libraries/chemistry/schema/broombridge).

## New functionality for Oracle synthesis

> New functions and operations in the [Microsoft.Quantum.Synthesis namespace](https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.synthesis) for coherently applying classical oracles using transformation- and decomposition-based synthesis algorithms.

This is some great new functionality for those that are working on writing oracles for their algorithms.
Oracles are basically a way of representing classical functions in quantum algorithims, if you want to learn more, check out [Chapter 7.4](https://livebook.manning.com/book/learn-quantum-computing-with-python-and-q-sharp/chapter-7/v-8/84) of [Learn Quantum Computing with Python and Q#](bit.ly/qsharp-book)!
The new namespace provides operations that help with taking truth tables or functions and helping you create an oracle that implements the table or function.

## Quality of life/Consistency improvements

> When using the simulator, qubits no longer need to be in the \|0âŸ© state upon release, but can be automatically reset if they were measured immediately before releasing.

The error messages for this before were not too bad and always helped remind me I forgot to explicitly reset a register of qubits, but I greatly appreciate this new feature.
If you have already measured your qubit(s) then the simulator will for sure know what state they are in and resetting them is trivial.
Thus if it is tracking that they were already measured and its time to release them, it can do whatever operations needed automatically to put them back in the |0âŸ© state.

> Moved operations:
>    - Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic.Assert is now Microsoft.Quantum.Diagnostics.AssertMeasurement
>    - Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic.AssertProb is now Microsoft.Quantum.Diagnostics.AssertMeasurementProbability

The new names here make it much more clear what the operations are actually doing.

> Removed deprecated Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive.* namespace

Finally clearing out that namespace I think will be good for clarity and also help make the language more inclusive.
It was originally deprecated in [0.6](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/resources/relnotes#version-061905) and renamed to the more descriptive Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic.

## Time to go update some code!

Anyway, I hope it was helpful to look at the release in context like this, I hope to be doing it for every release I can in the future!

Remember, quantum isn't magic but you are âœ¨
