I am an experimental physicist turned software developer with over 15 years experience in developing and managing cutting-edge tech projects. While not from Seattle originally, I have found my home here and enjoy [writing books]({{site.baseurl}}/books) about cool technologies (on a [split ergo](https://twitter.com/crazy4pi314/status/1382447930066444290?s=20)), cutting things with lasers, and playing with my pup Chewie.

### 👩‍💻 Experience

I got my PhD in Physics (Quantum Computing) by starting plasma fires with lasers to hack quantum crypto devices and trying to send and detect single photons in space ([read her thesis](http://hdl.handle.net/10012/10725)). As a developer, Python is my go-to language for most things, but I also dabble in Rust and program quantum computers in Q#. In 2021 I was awarded a Python Software Foundation Fellowship, and I'm currently working at Microsoft as a developer advocate for the Python OSS community.

**Cool stuff I have worked on:**
🚀 Low noise optical systems on satellites
👓 Virtual reality hardware
💎 Nanodiamonds for quantum sensing at cryogenic temperatures (automated with Python and Jupyter Notebooks 💖)
💻 Software tools and languages for quantum computers

### 💞 Passions

I am a vocal activist for diversity and inclusion in STEM fields and often give [presentations]({{site.baseurl}}/events) on my experiences and perspective as bisexual woman in tech. Live streaming quantum software development on [Twitch]({{site.social.twitch}}) has been another great way I  connect with folks to make quantum tech more accessible.
