  Quantum computing is an exciting and growing field that needs to train a new generation of programmers to leverage quantum technologies. There are lots of barriers to engaging new learners in quantum computing, which often stem from the language and traditional methods by which it is usually taught. Q# is the new quantum programming language developed by Microsoft, and offers a unique new approach to teaching quantum programming concepts with a domain-specific language. In this session, I will demo some core quantum computing concepts using Q# and Python.
