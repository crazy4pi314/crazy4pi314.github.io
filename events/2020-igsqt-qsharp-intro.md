  As the field of Quantum Computing expands from the academic to the industry realm, we need a way that we can continue to collaborate and innovate in both regimes. Open source quantum software development platforms like the Quantum Development Kit and Q# from Microsoft, serve as a bridge to connect research ideas to reality. In this talk, I will give you a tour of what you can do with Q# and show you an example of how I am using it in my own research on qRAMs. After this talk, you will have the resources you need to dive into using Q# for your own research projects!
