abstract: |
  Cryptography is an important social and technical aspect of our modern world.
  The physical nature by which we can obscure or encrypt information has changed drastically with new technologies that allow for the manipulation of quantum information.
  We now use Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) quite readily to exchange random bit strings called keys between parties.
  I will discuss some of the possible paths forward to making this a practical technology, including looking at hardware vulnerabilities as well as how to extend the physical reach of the systems.
