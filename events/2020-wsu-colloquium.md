abstract: |
  Science isn't — and can't — be done in isolation.
  I have spent much of my life in dark labs counting single photons, but it took a team to achieve our goals.
  The communities you build throughout your career will be the best resource you have to grow and develop as scientists, professionals, and humans.
  I will talk a bit about how each of the different communities I have been a part of have shaped my career, and my research.
