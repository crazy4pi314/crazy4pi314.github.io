  In the rush to add the word _quantum_ to everything from batteries to banking, Quantum machine learning has entered the fray.
  A perfect combination of buzzwords that will get all of the funding....right? 
  In this talk I want to look at quantum algorithms and what actually constitutes programming a quantum computer.
  With this context, we can look at what machine learning tasks are being explored for possible speedups with quantum computing.
