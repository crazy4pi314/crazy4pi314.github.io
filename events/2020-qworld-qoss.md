abstract: |
  When we are developing new technology, it is our communities that develop and drive us further than any individual effort could. We have lots of examples of how communities have helped shape other technologies and in particular open source software projects and people that now underpin much of our current software ecosystems. I want to share with you my journey from academia working as an open-source quantum developer at the Unitary Fund, what I have learned about the role that open source software has to play in developing quantum technologies, and how you can help grow our quantum community.
