abstract: |
  Technology canâ€™t be developed in isolation, nor can we separate the tech from the people that develop it. 
  The communities of people you connect with throughout your career will be one of the best resource you have to grow and develop as both a tech professional and human. 
  I will talk a bit about how each of the different communities I have been a part of have shaped my career path and success. 
  I will also give some tips on how we can be intentional about the communities we build and participate in so that they can be that critical resource to everyone.
