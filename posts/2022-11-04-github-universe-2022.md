I cannot believe it's almost time for GitHub Universe 2022!! It has been super fun working with the [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) team and the [QIR Alliance](https://www.qir-alliance.org/) to prepare for the event, and I'm so excited to be able to share what I have been up to.

tl;dr: _You can develop for and with quantum computers from your tablet on the beach_ üòé

Bold claim, I know, but I will show you in my Community Stage session **[Quantum development with Codespaces](https://githubuniverse.com/events/detail/virtual-schedule/00191b20-fdaa-4930-9) on Thursday Nov 10 from 11:30 AM - 12:00 PM**. The demo I put together will show you an example of how the  QIR alliance is using tools like [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), Python and [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org) to build the infrastructure for quantum computing. The QIR alliance is a Linux Foundataion project that helps develop the specifications for the compilers, front-ends, and hardware that make quantum devices work.

I'll be posting during the event on [Mastodon](https://mathstodon.xyz/@crazy4pi314), and make sure to check back here for my notes on the event as well as some more fun experiments with Python and Codespaces üêçüíñ
