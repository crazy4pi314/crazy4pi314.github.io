Finally, I have been messing around with other static site generators for a refresh of my website and finally settled on [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and starting from this great [fernfolio](https://fernfolio.netlify.app/) template.
I have used 11ty now to build a few static sites, and am really appreciating how much work web dev can be to get things juuuuust right :)
While this isn't exactly 100% my vision yet, I have a few key tasks that I am sure I will work on between projects:

- Make it easy to add/embed [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) and [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) in pages
- Figure out how to run [pyscript](https://pyscript.net/) on pages
- Make better automated captures of my social media posts + GitHub stats
- Add a page for Chewie pics 🐕🥰

Anyway I'll probably be tracking this on the [issues](https://github.com/crazy4pi314/crazy4pi314.github.io/issues) for the repo for this site, so if you think of other ideas for stuff to try let me know by filing an issue!
