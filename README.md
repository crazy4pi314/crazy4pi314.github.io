Hiya!


I has spent most of her career developing technology in the lab, from virtual reality hardware to satellites. My Ph.D. is in Physics, which she got by starting fires with lasers in space controlled by Python and Jupyter Notebooks. She is now a Cloud Advocate for Python at Microsoft, contributing to open source projects and building communities for scientific Python tools. She has written tech books for all ages like Learn Quantum Computing with Python and Q# and ABCs of Engineering.
