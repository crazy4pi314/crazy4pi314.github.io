### Summary

Learn Quantum Computing with Python and Q# introduces quantum computing from a practical perspective. Use Python to build your own quantum simulator and take advantage of Microsoft’s open source tools to fine-tune quantum algorithms. The authors explain complex math and theory through stories, visuals, and games. You’ll learn to apply quantum to real-world applications, such as sending secret messages and solving chemistry problems.
