    • Part 1: quantum resources, what are they?
        ○ Qubit, what it is <Whiteboard>
        ○ Superposition <Whiteboard>
        ○ Entanglement <Whiteboard>
        
    • Part 2: Computing?
        ○ How does this make a quantum computer
        ○ What can quantum computers do
            § Deutch Jorza
            § Grovers
            § Shor
            § Others
        ○ How are they beating classical?
            § Something of an open question
            § Better at noisy functions
            § Improvement is heavily state dependent
            § Not strictly better at deterministic functions
        ○ Common Misconceptions
            § Superposition does not mean in two states at once
            § Quantum teleportation teleports information, not anything physical
            § All quantum systems are non-deterministic, results are probabilistic
            
            § http://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/the-talk-3
            § DWAVE is not a quantum computer
                □ It is not proven to be quantum, this is still debated
                □ Even if it is quantum it is analogue
                □ It is not a computer, it is an annealer
            § Quantum crypto, just like classical crypto is not infallible. Just because the protocols work doesn’t mean the implementation does
            § No such thing as quantum safe, just because it hasn’t been broken with any of the grand total of three algorithms doesn’t make it secure
            § There may exist algorithms that quantum computers are not good at solving, this does not mean that classical computers will also be bad at solving them
    
            
    • Part 3: QKD
        ○ How can quantum resources make things secure?
        ○ QKD protocols?
            § SPACE!!!!!
        ○ Why is this not enough?
            § SIDECHANNELS.
            § Poor implementations



 
 
By Invitation Only
 
Join us and your fellow peers on Thursday 23rd February for our second Sydney Crypto Club.

Crypto Club provides you with a crypto dedicated forum to interact and learn from guest speakers and like-minded individuals about all things Crypto and benefit from:
Sharing crypto deployment experiences 
Networking opportunities
Raising specific questions and introducing new subjects
 
 
Topic : Photon phreaking or what quantum can (actually) do for security?
 
What properties of quantum systems can be useful for cryptography? Quantum systems have the potential
to be new cryptographic tools and force us to re-examine our current assumptions of computational 
complexity. We will look at some interesting examples of the new tech and protocols like quantum 
key distribution and "quantum hacking", quantum random number generators, quantum computing and
algorithms. What consequences do these technologies have for our current cryptographic infrastructure?
