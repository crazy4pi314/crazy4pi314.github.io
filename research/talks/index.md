## 2017 ##

- ### [Spontaneous Superradiance from Single Diamond Nanocrystals](./NDNC_2017): NDNC 2017###

- ### [Extending the reach of QKD](./UTS_seminar_2017): UTS Seminar ###

    Cryptography is an important social and technical aspect of our modern world. The physical nature by which we can obscure or encrypt information has changed drastically with new technologies that allow for the manipulation of quantum information. We now use Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) quite readily to exchange random bit strings called keys between parties. I will discuss some of the possible paths forward to making this a practical technology, including looking at hardware vulnerabilities as well as how to extend the physical reach of the systems. 

- ### [Photon phreaking: What quantum can (actually) do for security](./crypto_club) :Gemalto Crypto Club ###

    In this talk, we will introduce what properties of quantum systems can be useful for cryptography. With quantum systems we can also improve in some very specific and limited ways our computational power for solving problems (like factoring large numbers). Thus quantum systems have the potential to be new cryptographic tools and force us to re-examine our current assumptions of computational complexity. We will look at some interesting examples of the new tech and protocols like quantum key distribution and "quantum hacking", quantum random number generators, quantum computing and algorithms. Lastly, we look at what consequences these technologies have for our current cryptographic infrastructure.
