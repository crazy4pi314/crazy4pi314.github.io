# Learning Q# with Python: building the quantum programming community

# _Outline_
### Intro
- Quick introduction a/b myself
- Tell me what you have heard about quantum computing?
  - wtf quantum headlines image
- Why are you not doing it?/What are some barriers to entry for the field
  - because this is the stereotype of who "should" be doing this (pics and quotes from white old dudes)
  - Its hard/need a degree/need to be a genius
  - you have no idea who would pay you to do so :P
- how can we do better? 
### Communities of people make software
  - Lets not narrow the description of who can participate, we need more ideas!!
    - Engage more programmers of all descriptions
  - improve how we communicate + teach about QC (no more shitty headlines)
    - Analogies must be used with extreme caution
    - Choose language carefully, lets not be spooky, fearmonger, or talk about quantum supremacy
    - more cat gifs (NO NOT SCHRODINGER'S CAT, LEAVE THEM ALONE )
- examples of more successful stem/tech communities
  - PYTHONS ISSsssssss one of many
    - R as well
  - First PRs welcome
  - encouraging and supporting members, not trying to prove we know all the things
  - meetup groups/hacknights
- Let's leverage/model our new programming community after inclusive, welcoming groups

### Quantum Programming â€” let's do it
- what the `$&@_!&$` is a qc anyway? 
    - can I mine Bitcoin with a quantum computer?!
    - can I teleport/do all the answers at once??
    - quantum chemistry?
    - Quantum Machine learning
- Lets just give this a go, try our using our tools to make it easier to just _try_ stuff:
    - Jupyter notebook + binder
- Q# is Domain specific, high level quantum programming language
    - it doesn't have to be hard, can do with tools you are familiar with C#, F# or Python for convenience
- QUBITS    
    - `let`s allocate one
    - what can we do with one?
- operations
    - show dump register
    - show ? op
- QRNG
    - randomness in places other than talks is good
    - we can use one of our simulated qubits to make a random number generator


### Hands on with quantum algorithims
- We know a few qa, some you may have heard of like shor's algorithim
- Lets look at a simpl(er) one and see if we can figure out how it works!
    - if we can develop the skill to program our algorithims, we can use the programs to figure out stuff
- Nimune the lady of the lake wants to...
- deutch joza
  - we need to encode the problem in the _phase_ of our qubits so that we can use properties like interference to cancel out wrong anwsers
- We know a couple of qa that single handidly do useful things, but others like DJ here we currently see as being good _sub routines_


### Where do we go from here?
- use case: cloud based GPU -esque
  - needs to be so isolated from everything, we won't be able to do that at home
- Challenges for a quantum computer that are different from my laptop:
  - encoding/translating the problem
  - size/number of resources available
  - 
- how will _i_ use one?
  - Near tearm there are certain properties of problems that we think would lend them to qc:
    - small datasets (input/storage is expensive)
    - not needing to see what happens inbetween 
    - needing a complex output, works better with simpler responses
  - with an amazing, inclusive community B)
    - DOPE AF RESOURCES LINK LINK LINK

### _Abstract_
Quantum computing is an exciting and growing field that needs to train a new generation of programmers to leverage quantum technologies.
There are lots of barriers to engaging new learners in quantum computing, which often stem from the the language and traditional methods by which it is usually taught.
Q# is the new quantum programming language developed by Microsoft, and offers a unique new approach to teaching quantum programming concepts with a domain-specific language.
In this session, I will demo some core quantum computing concepts using Q# and Python.
Leveraging Python as a language and a community helps newcomers to quantum programing get up and going faster.

### _Bio_
Dr. Sarah Kaiser has spent much of her career developing new quantum hardware in the lab, from satellites to hacking quantum cryptography hardware.
Communicating what is so exciting about quantum is her passion, and she loves finding new demos and tools to help enable the quantum community to grow.
When not at the keyboard she loves kayaking and writing books about engineering for kids.
Just like the electromagnetic spectrum, she believes there is room for everyone to learn quantum and become a quantum programmer!

## Notes from call with Christy

- If they believe they can learn it, they can
    - [Carol Dweck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Dweck) stanford
    - fixed mindset/growth mindset
- tell me a story as to why you feel like you are shit at this
- bad teaching creates environments where no one can learn
- societal impact of math anxiety
- I believe in you, you can do this!
